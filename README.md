# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application for extracting, cleaning, and analyzing tabular and textual data from Greek PDF documents, with support for processing the data using various large language models (LLMs). It is designed for educational or administrative data workflows, as suggested by the PDF filenames in the `data/` directory.

## File Descriptions
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application. It:
  - Extracts data from a selected PDF using the parser in `test_new_parser.py`.
  - Prompts the user to select an LLM (e.g., Claude, Llama, DeepSeek) to process the extracted data.
  - Calls the chosen LLM module from the `llms/` directory and saves the model's response to the `outputs/` directory.
  - Supports running multiple models in sequence based on user input.

- `test_new_parser.py`: Contains the core PDF parsing and data extraction logic. It:
  - Uses `pymupdf4llm` to convert PDFs to Markdown.
  - Cleans up common Greek text extraction errors.
  - Extracts introductory text and parses all tables from the PDF, handling multi-line rows and various table formats based on the PDF filename.
  - Returns the cleaned introductory text and a list of dictionaries representing table rows.

- `credentials.py`: Intended for storing credentials or authentication information (such as API keys for LLMs). **Do not share this file publicly.**

- `llms/`: Contains Python modules for different large language models:
  - `claude3_7.py`, `claude3_5.py`, `claude4_sonnet.py`, `llama.py`, `deepseek.py`, `pixtral.py`: Each file provides an interface to a specific LLM, exposing a function that takes extracted text and data as input and returns the model's response.

- `data/`: Contains input PDF files to be processed.
- `outputs/`: Stores output files generated by the application (e.g., LLM responses).
- `images/`: (May contain images, not listed in detail.)

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed.
   - Install required packages (if any). If a `requirements.txt` is missing, install common packages such as `PyPDF2`, `requests`, or any LLM-related dependencies as needed.

2. **Run the Application**
   - Execute the main script:
     ```powershell
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Testing**
   - Run tests using:
     ```powershell
     python test_new_parser.py
     ```

## LLM Integration
The `llms/` directory contains modules for different large language models. Each file (e.g., `claude3_5.py`, `llama.py`) likely provides an interface to interact with a specific LLM. Review each file for usage details.

## Data Files
The `data/` directory contains several PDF files, which are likely processed or analyzed by the application. Ensure these files are present for the application to function correctly.

## Credentials
If `credentials.py` is used, you may need to provide API keys or other sensitive information. Do not share this file publicly.

## Outputs
Results or processed data may be saved in the `outputs/` directory.
